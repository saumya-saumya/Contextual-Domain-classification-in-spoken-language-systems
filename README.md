# Contextual-Domain-classification-in-spoken-language-systems
The Convolution Neural Network classifies the spoken language statements into different Domains.
This Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification accomplishes great arrangement execution over a scope of content grouping assignments (like Sentiment Analysis) and has since turned into a standard benchmark for new text classification structures. The model segregates the commands given by the co-pilot in car or automobile to perform particular task. Hence the commands are assigned to particular domain to which it belongs and then further actions can be taken to provide information to pilot. In this project, due to less availability of data it is restricted have to only three domains i.e., News, Control and Weather and trained them on CNN network to classify into three Domains.
