# Contextual-Domain-classification-in-spoken-language-systems
The Convolution Neural Network classifies the spoken language statements into different Domains.
This Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification accomplishes great arrangement execution over a scope of content grouping assignments (like Sentiment Analysis) and has since turned into a standard benchmark for new text classification structures. The model segregates the commands given by the co-pilot in car or automobile to perform particular task. Hence the commands are assigned to particular domain to which it belongs and then further actions can be taken to provide information to pilot. In this project, due to less availability of data it is restricted have to only three domains i.e., News, Control and Weather and trained them on CNN network to classify into three Domains.

<li>The main idea of this project is to classify the human utterance sentences into their domain according to its intend for autopilot prototype.</li>
                    <li>Data collected using flask UI and deployed games for users to interact and input sentences to have large dataset.</li>
					<li>Data processing and data anlayis on the type of data collected</li>
					<li>Experiment on different input methods used for sentences like Bag-of-words N-gram,CountVectorizer and Word to Vectors.
					Also used different Nerual Networks but the performance outperformed with RCNN.</li> 
                    <li>The final result of the project,in realtime the model can classify the sentences into its domain with 86% accuracy.</li>
